---

## ✅ 2. Which file contains full information about any thread in the JVM?

### **Thread Dump**

* It provides a snapshot of all active threads in the JVM with their current state.
* **Location**: Usually generated via `jstack` or tools like VisualVM, or from `/dump` endpoint via Spring Actuator.
* **Contains**:

  * Thread name
  * State (`RUNNABLE`, `BLOCKED`, `WAITING`, etc.)
  * Stack trace
  * Locks held or waited on
