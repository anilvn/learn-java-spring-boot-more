Great and very **practical interview question** ‚Äî here‚Äôs how you can **confidently answer** this as someone working in a Spring Boot microservices project who recently migrated from JSP MVC to Spring Boot microservices, even though you have dev & UAT environments.

I‚Äôll structure the answer into:
‚úÖ Examples of **realistic prod issues**
‚úÖ **Why these weren‚Äôt found** in dev/UAT
‚úÖ **How we troubleshooted & fixed them**

---

## üõ† **Recent production issues & why they slipped through dev/UAT**

### ‚úÖ 1. **Issue: Memory leak / OOM in one microservice**

* **Context:** We migrated a monolithic JSP MVC app to Spring Boot microservices. In prod, one microservice handling bulk data export started crashing with `OutOfMemoryError`.
* **Why missed in UAT/dev:**

  * UAT/dev had limited, smaller test data sets.
  * Production had huge data volumes + concurrent export requests which were not fully simulated.
* **Troubleshooting & resolution:**

  * Enabled Spring Boot **actuator** heap dump + GC logs.
  * Identified large objects kept in memory (e.g., large DTO lists).
  * Added **pagination**, **streaming** responses (`ResponseBodyEmitter`).
  * Tuned JVM heap & monitored with Grafana + Prometheus.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Issue: Circuit breaker open (Resilience4j) ‚Üí partial outage**

* **Context:** Microservice A depends on B. In prod, B was slow due to high load ‚Üí circuit breaker in A opened ‚Üí user-facing feature unavailable.
* **Why missed in UAT/dev:**

  * UAT/dev don‚Äôt have realistic traffic/load; circuit breaker thresholds were never hit.
* **Troubleshooting & resolution:**

  * Used actuator metrics `/actuator/metrics/resilience4j.circuitbreaker` and logs.
  * Optimized B‚Äôs slow query.
  * Increased thread pool & tuned circuit breaker config (`slidingWindowSize`, `waitDurationInOpenState`).

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Issue: Wrong data shown because of missing index**

* **Context:** After migration, one reporting API was very slow in prod; sometimes timed out.
* **Why missed in UAT/dev:**

  * Smaller DB in UAT/dev ‚Üí query ran fine; prod had millions of rows.
* **Troubleshooting & resolution:**

  * Checked slow query logs in prod.
  * Found missing index.
  * Added index; query time improved dramatically.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Issue: Different third-party API behavior in prod**

* **Context:** Microservice was calling a third-party payment API.
* In UAT, we used sandbox; in prod, real API had stricter validation (e.g., required fields).
* **Why missed in UAT:** Sandbox doesn‚Äôt fully match prod behavior.
* **Troubleshooting & fix:**

  * Added better validation.
  * Logged full request/response (with masking sensitive data).

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Issue: Race condition / concurrency issue**

* **Context:** In prod, concurrent requests caused data duplication.
* **Why missed in UAT/dev:** UAT traffic was low; concurrency not simulated.
* **Troubleshooting:**

  * Analyzed logs.
  * Added DB constraint + synchronized block / atomic operations.

---

## üöÄ **Why these issues bypassed dev & UAT:**

Even with dev & UAT environments:

* Real production data volume & traffic patterns are hard to replicate.
* Real user behavior, concurrency, and traffic spikes can‚Äôt be simulated fully.
* External systems (payment APIs, etc.) behave differently in real production.
* Some configs (e.g., JVM, DB indexes) may differ slightly between UAT/prod.

---

## üõ° **Quick summary (for interview):**

> ‚ÄúEven though we had dev/UAT, certain issues like high data volume, real user concurrency, and external API differences only surfaced in prod. We mitigated this by adding better monitoring (actuator, logs, dashboards), doing load tests with near-prod data, and tuning configs in prod based on metrics.‚Äù

If you'd like,
‚úÖ I can draft this as a **clean, ready-to-speak answer** (or write it as you'd say in interview).
Would you like me to?

I should clarify that I'm Claude, an AI assistant, so I haven't personally migrated any projects or faced production issues. However, I can share common production issues that development teams typically encounter when migrating from JSP MVC to Spring Boot microservices, along with troubleshooting approaches and collaboration strategies.

## Common Production Issues After JSP to Spring Boot Migration

**Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**
- **Issue**: Applications would randomly become unresponsive due to connection pool limits being hit under production load
- **Troubleshooting**: Monitor connection pool metrics, analyze database query patterns, and implement connection pooling best practices
- **Why missed in dev/UAT**: Lower concurrent user load doesn't stress connection pools the same way production traffic does

**Service Discovery and Load Balancing Problems**
- **Issue**: Services failing to discover each other intermittently, causing cascade failures
- **Troubleshooting**: Implement health checks, circuit breakers, and proper service registry configuration
- **Why missed**: Development environments often use direct service-to-service calls rather than full service discovery

**Memory Leaks and Garbage Collection Issues**
- **Issue**: Applications consuming excessive memory over time, leading to OutOfMemoryErrors
- **Troubleshooting**: Heap dump analysis, GC tuning, and profiling tools like JProfiler or async-profiler
- **Why missed**: Production data volumes and long-running processes expose memory issues not visible in shorter UAT cycles

**Session Management Complications**
- **Issue**: User sessions not properly distributed across microservices, causing authentication failures
- **Troubleshooting**: Implement distributed session storage (Redis) or stateless JWT-based authentication
- **Why missed**: Single-user testing in dev/UAT doesn't reveal session distribution complexities

## Collaboration Strategies for Production Issues

**Monitoring and Alerting Setup**
- Use APM tools (New Relic, Datadog, or open-source alternatives like Micrometer with Prometheus)
- Set up centralized logging with ELK stack or similar
- Implement distributed tracing for microservices communication

**Cross-functional Collaboration**
- Establish incident response procedures with DevOps and operations teams
- Create runbooks for common issues and troubleshooting steps
- Use collaboration tools like Slack or Teams for real-time communication during incidents

**Proactive Detection**
- Implement chaos engineering practices to test failure scenarios
- Set up synthetic monitoring to catch issues before users do
- Create comprehensive dashboards showing system health metrics

**Knowledge Sharing**
- Conduct post-incident reviews to understand root causes
- Document lessons learned and update testing procedures
- Share knowledge across development teams to prevent similar issues

The key is building robust observability into your microservices architecture from the start and establishing clear communication channels between development and operations teams for rapid issue resolution.
