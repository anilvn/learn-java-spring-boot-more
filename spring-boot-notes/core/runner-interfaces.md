## Overview
Both `ApplicationRunner` and `CommandLineRunner` are functional interfaces in Spring Boot that allow you to execute code after the Spring application context has been loaded and before the application is ready to serve requests.

## ApplicationRunner

### Definition
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface ApplicationRunner {
    void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception;
}
```

### Key Characteristics
- Receives `ApplicationArguments` object as parameter
- Provides structured access to command-line arguments
- Can distinguish between option arguments (`--key=value`) and non-option arguments
- Better for applications that need to parse complex command-line arguments

### Usage Example
```java
@Component
public class MyApplicationRunner implements ApplicationRunner {
    @Override
    public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Option names: " + args.getOptionNames());
        System.out.println("Non-option args: " + args.getNonOptionArgs());
        
        if (args.containsOption("debug")) {
            System.out.println("Debug mode enabled");
        }
    }
}
```

## CommandLineRunner

### Definition
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface CommandLineRunner {
    void run(String... args) throws Exception;
}
```

### Key Characteristics
- Receives raw string array of command-line arguments
- Simple and straightforward approach
- Direct access to arguments as passed to main method
- Better for simple argument processing

### Usage Example
```java
@Component
public class MyCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Application started with arguments:");
        for (String arg : args) {
            System.out.println(arg);
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | ApplicationRunner | CommandLineRunner |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Parameter Type** | `ApplicationArguments` | `String... args` |
| **Argument Parsing** | Structured parsing with option/non-option distinction | Raw string array |
| **Complexity** | More sophisticated | Simpler |
| **Use Case** | Complex argument processing | Simple argument handling |

## When to Use Which

### Use ApplicationRunner When:
- You need to distinguish between option arguments (`--prop=value`) and non-option arguments
- Your application requires complex command-line argument parsing
- You want to check for specific options or flags
- You need to access argument values by option names
- Building applications with sophisticated CLI interfaces

### Use CommandLineRunner When:
- You have simple argument processing needs
- You want direct access to raw command-line arguments
- Your application doesn't require complex argument parsing
- You're performing basic initialization tasks
- You prefer a simpler, more straightforward approach

## Common Use Cases

### Both interfaces are commonly used for:
- **Database initialization** - Creating tables, inserting seed data
- **Cache warming** - Pre-loading frequently accessed data
- **External service connectivity** - Testing connections to APIs or databases
- **Configuration validation** - Verifying application settings
- **Scheduled job setup** - Initializing background tasks
- **File system operations** - Creating directories, checking file permissions

## Execution Order
Both runners execute after the application context is fully loaded but before the application starts accepting requests. If you have multiple runners, you can control their execution order using the `@Order` annotation:

```java
@Component
@Order(1)
public class FirstRunner implements ApplicationRunner {
    // Executes first
}

@Component
@Order(2)
public class SecondRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
    // Executes second
}
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### ApplicationRunner
**Advantages:**
- Structured argument parsing
- Easy option detection and value extraction
- Better for complex CLI applications
- Type-safe argument handling

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly more complex to use
- Overhead of ApplicationArguments object creation
- May be overkill for simple use cases

### CommandLineRunner
**Advantages:**
- Simple and intuitive
- Direct access to raw arguments
- Minimal overhead
- Easy to understand and implement

**Disadvantages:**
- Manual argument parsing required
- No built-in option/non-option distinction
- Less suitable for complex argument structures
- More prone to parsing errors

## Best Practices
- Use `ApplicationRunner` for applications with complex command-line interfaces
- Use `CommandLineRunner` for simple initialization tasks
- Implement proper error handling in both cases
- Use `@Order` annotation when multiple runners are present
- Keep runner logic lightweight and focused
- Consider using `@Profile` to conditionally enable runners in different environments

Both interfaces serve similar purposes but offer different levels of sophistication in handling command-line arguments. Choose based on your application's complexity and argument processing requirements.
