# BeanFactory vs ApplicationContext - Validation & Comparison

## âœ… **Diagram Validation: ACCURATE**
All information in the diagram is correct according to Spring Framework documentation.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | BeanFactory | ApplicationContext |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Basic container for managing beans | Advanced container with full Spring framework support |
| **Bean Loading Strategy** | Lazy loading (loads beans on demand via `getBean()`) | Eager loading (loads beans on startup by default) |
| **Auto-Scanning & Annotations** | Limited support for annotation-based configuration | Full support for annotations and component scanning |
| **Scope Support** | Singleton and prototype scopes only | All bean scopes (singleton, prototype, request, session, global session) |
| **AOP Support** | No built-in AOP support | Extensive AOP support with declarative transactions |
| **Resource Management** | Limited (ClassPathResource only) | Full ResourceLoader interface support (URLs, files, classpath) |
| **Event Publishing** | No event publishing support | Supports event publishing via ApplicationEventPublisher |
| **Additional Features** | Basic dependency injection only | i18n, lifecycle callbacks, web application support |

## Key Notes

- ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory interface and provides all basic functionality plus advanced features
- BeanFactory uses lazy loading while ApplicationContext uses eager initialization for singleton beans
- ApplicationContext implements ResourceLoader interface for resource management
- ApplicationContext supports enterprise features like internationalization and event propagation
- Modern Spring applications should use ApplicationContext over BeanFactory for full framework capabilities
